# Academic Meta-Review Summarization
This project focuses on automatic summarization of meta-review data for academic papers using a fine-tuned pre-trained Generative AI (LLM) model. The project leverages a public meta-review dataset, fine-tunes a transformer-based language model, and generates concise summaries that capture the key points of the reviews.
